# Scope

## What WARScribe IS

WARScribe is an **action notation system**:
- Maps unit names to short IDs
- Records gameplay actions in structured format
- Generates machine-readable match transcripts

## What WARScribe IS NOT

WARScribe does **not** validate army lists:
- No point limit checking
- No detachment legality
- No loadout rule enforcement

!!! info "Accepted Risk"
    Lists may declare units that are mechanically illegal. Future projects needing list validation require a separate validation layer. This is a documented **open risk**.

## Why This Scope?

- List validation is complex and game-version dependent
- Action notation is stable across editions
- Keeps the core library focused and maintainable
